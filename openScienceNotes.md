# Open Science

These notes were taken at & before the CBMM retreat open science breakout session. These aren't official CBMM opinions - just ideas thrown out by atendees.

## Motivation

### Collaboration
 
### Robustness through bug-fixes
 
## Big Examples

 ![](http://juxi.net/projects/iCub/pics/icub-upright.png)

 - [iCub](icub.org) (on [github](github.com/rotobology/icub-main))
 - [OpenCV](github.com/itseez/opencv)
 - Facebook (Hack, React, Haxl, Flow)
 - Microsoft (.NET)
 - Apple (Swift)
 - Mozilla (Firefox, Rust)

## Smaller examples

 - [Caffe](github.com/caffe)
 - [Publons](publons.com), [reffit](reffit.com)
 - My [thesis](github.com/imalsogreg/RetroProject)
 
## Concrete Directions to go in

 - The CBMM Online journal
   - (Typesetting costs? [pandoc!](pandoc.org) )
   - Author respect-tracking?
   - Corrections? (paper sources held on github)
 - Encouraging open-access project code
 - Open peer review
 - Open publication
 - Open data
 - Facilitated data interaction
 - *High quality* behavioral journal
 - Sifting through too many papers in fully open journals: [pubchase](https://www.pubchase.com/)
 - Totally open journal, with $50 submission fee? (for server maintenance and just to keep rifraff out)
 
## Success Stories

## Failure Stories

 - Current peer review system: broken filter!
 - Major wast of time (major!) trying to publish in traditional glamour journals :)
 - open access publications that got scooped before being republished in traditional journal 
   - (examples?)
 - How to track changes?
